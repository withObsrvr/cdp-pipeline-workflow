# PR Review Changes Summary

## Overview
Applied changes based on Copilot's PR review feedback to improve code quality, maintainability, and robustness.

## Changes Applied

### 1. Improved Comment Documentation
**File:** `source_adapter_test.go`
- Enhanced comment clarity for error handling in processor loop
- Changed from: `// Log but continue with other processors`
- Changed to: `// Log the error returned by this processor, but continue processing with other processors to ensure all processors have a chance to handle the message, even if one fails.`

### 2. Enhanced URL Validation
**File:** `source_adapter_rpc_test.go`
- Replaced simplistic string prefix checking with proper URL parsing
- Added `net/url` import
- Now uses `url.Parse()` for robust URL validation checking scheme and host

### 3. Replaced Magic Numbers with Constants
**File:** `source_adapter_gcs_test.go`
- Added named constants for better code maintainability:
  - `FilesPerPartition = 64000`
  - `LedgersPerFileGroup = 1000`
- Updated all usages of magic numbers to use these constants

### 4. Added Stroops Conversion Constant
**File:** `processor/processor_transform_to_app_payment_test.go`
- Added `stroopsPerXLM = 10000000.0` constant
- Replaced all hardcoded `10000000.0` values with the constant
- Improves code readability and maintainability

### 5. Improved PowerShell Error Handling
**File:** `scripts/install.ps1`
- Enhanced COM object creation error handling
- Added specific error message for COM registration failures
- Gracefully handles environments where COM objects are unavailable

### 6. Enhanced Test Script Debugging
**File:** `scripts/test-install.sh`
- Modified to capture stderr to a log file instead of discarding it
- Shows error output when tests fail for better debugging
- Cleans up log files after successful tests

### 7. Dynamic Mock Data Generation
**File:** `processor/processor_contract_data_test.go`
- Replaced hardcoded loop count (2) with dynamic calculation based on contractIDs
- Mock now generates entries based on actual test data
- Defaults to 1 entry if no contract IDs are specified

### 8. Added Dependency Documentation
**File:** `internal/cli/cmd/version.go`
- Added inline comment documenting the fatih/color dependency
- Explains it's used for terminal color output for better UX

## Changes NOT Applied

### JSON Parsing with jq (install.sh)
**Reason:** Requiring `jq` would violate the "no prerequisites except curl/wget" design goal. The current sed/grep approach, while less elegant, maintains the zero-dependency installation experience.

## Testing Recommendations

1. Run the updated test suite to ensure all changes work correctly:
   ```bash
   go test ./...
   ```

2. Test the installation scripts on various platforms:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/test-install.sh
   ```

3. Verify PowerShell script on Windows systems with and without COM support

## Benefits
- Improved code maintainability through better documentation
- Enhanced robustness with proper validation and error handling
- Better debugging capabilities in test scripts
- More flexible and realistic test mocks
- Clearer code intent through named constants
