# FlowCTL CLI Implementation Summary

## Overview

The FlowCTL CLI implementation plan has been updated to focus solely on the `run` command, removing all other commands (init, dev, test, validate, list) as requested.

## Key Changes

### Simplified Command Structure
- **Single Command**: Only `flowctl run <config file>` 
- **No subcommands**: Removed init, dev, test, validate, and list commands
- **Clean interface**: Focus on running pipelines efficiently

### Reduced Dependencies
```go
// Only essential dependencies
github.com/spf13/cobra v1.8.0
github.com/spf13/viper v1.18.2
github.com/fatih/color v1.16.0
```

### Streamlined Architecture
```
internal/cli/
├── cmd/
│   ├── root.go    # Root command setup
│   └── run.go     # Run command only
├── config/
│   └── config.go  # Viper configuration
└── runner/
    └── runner.go  # Pipeline execution
```

### Usage Examples
```bash
# Basic usage
flowctl run pipeline.yaml

# With checkpoint directory
flowctl run pipeline.yaml --checkpoint-dir ./checkpoints

# With verbose output
flowctl run pipeline.yaml -v
```

## Implementation Focus

1. **Week 1**: Build core CLI with run command
2. **Week 2**: Testing and documentation
3. **Week 3**: Migration guide and adoption

## Benefits of Simplified Approach

- **Faster implementation**: Single command reduces complexity
- **Easier adoption**: Users only need to learn one command
- **Cleaner codebase**: Less code to maintain
- **Future-ready**: Foundation allows adding commands later if needed

## Migration Path

Users will transition from:
```bash
./cdp-pipeline-workflow -config config.yaml
```

To:
```bash
flowctl run config.yaml
```

The simplified approach maintains all functionality while providing a cleaner interface.
