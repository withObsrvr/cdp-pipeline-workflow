# CDP Pipeline - Flowctl Integration Summary

## Implementation Complete

The CDP pipeline has been successfully integrated with flowctl's control plane. Here's what was implemented:

### 1. Core Integration Components

#### pkg/control/client.go
- gRPC client for communicating with flowctl control plane
- Supports service registration and heartbeat
- Uses SERVICE_TYPE_PIPELINE (added to flowctl proto)
- Configurable via FLOWCTL_ENDPOINT environment variable

#### pkg/control/stats.go
- Stats aggregation from all pipeline components
- Implements MetricsProvider and HealthChecker interfaces
- Tracks component health based on last update time
- Provides pipeline-level and component-level metrics

### 2. Main Pipeline Changes

#### main.go updates:
- Added control plane client initialization in `setupPipeline()`
- Automatic registration when FLOWCTL_ENDPOINT is set
- Heartbeat loop runs every 10 seconds
- Graceful handling if control plane is unavailable

### 3. Example Component Integration

#### processor/processor_contract_events.go
- Added `GetStatsForControl()` method implementing StatsProvider
- Reports:
  - processed_ledgers
  - events_found
  - successful_events
  - failed_events
  - last_ledger
  - last_processed_time

### 4. Configuration

No changes to existing YAML configs. Control plane is configured via environment:

```bash
export FLOWCTL_ENDPOINT=localhost:8080  # Enable control plane
export CDP_PIPELINE_NAME=my-pipeline    # Optional: override name
```

### 5. Key Design Decisions

1. **Single Unit Registration**: Each CDP pipeline registers as a single SERVICE_TYPE_PIPELINE unit
2. **Non-Invasive**: Control plane integration is optional and doesn't affect performance
3. **Backward Compatible**: Pipelines work exactly as before when FLOWCTL_ENDPOINT is not set
4. **Minimal Code Changes**: Only added control package and minimal changes to main.go

### 6. Testing

Created test script: `test_control_plane.sh`
- Verifies build
- Checks configuration
- Provides testing instructions

## Next Steps

To use the integration:

1. Build CDP pipeline:
   ```bash
   CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -o cdp-pipeline-workflow
   ```

2. Start flowctl server:
   ```bash
   flowctl server --storage-type boltdb
   ```

3. Run pipeline with control plane:
   ```bash
   export FLOWCTL_ENDPOINT=localhost:8080
   ./cdp-pipeline-workflow -config config/contract_events.yaml
   ```

4. Check status:
   ```bash
   flowctl status
   flowctl status <pipeline-id>
   ```

## Additional Components to Update

To expand metrics coverage, implement StatsProvider in:
- Source adapters (BufferedStorageSourceAdapter, etc.)
- Other processors (FilterPayments, TransformToAppPayment, etc.)
- Consumers (SaveToParquet, SaveToPostgreSQL, etc.)

Each component just needs to add a `GetStats() control.ComponentStats` method.
