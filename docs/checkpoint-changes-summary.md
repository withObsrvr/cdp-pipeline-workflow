# Checkpoint Feature Update Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. FlowCTL Implementation Plan
**Removed checkpoint references** to keep the initial implementation simple:
- Removed `--checkpoint-dir` flag from the run command
- Removed `CheckpointDir` field from runner Options struct
- Removed checkpoint examples from documentation
- Simplified the implementation to focus on core CLI transformation

### 2. Vision and Enhancements Document
**Added comprehensive checkpointing section** (Section 11) with:

#### Basic Features
- Simple checkpoint configuration with interval-based saves
- Local and distributed storage options (Redis, etcd)
- Configurable checkpoint content and triggers

#### Advanced Features
- Adaptive checkpointing strategy based on throughput
- Distributed checkpointing for multi-worker pipelines
- Coordinated barriers for consistent snapshots
- Checkpoint compression and TTL management

#### Developer Interface
- `Checkpointable` interface for custom processor state
- Programmatic API for save/restore operations
- CLI commands for checkpoint management:
  - `flowctl run --checkpoint-dir` (future)
  - `flowctl run --resume` (future)
  - `flowctl checkpoint list/show/clean` (future)

#### Recovery and Reliability
- Automatic recovery modes
- Corruption handling strategies
- Checkpoint validation and integrity checks
- Age-based checkpoint management

## Rationale

1. **Simplify Initial Implementation**: The flowctl CLI transformation is already a significant change. Adding checkpointing would increase complexity and delay delivery.

2. **Future-Proof Design**: By documenting checkpointing thoroughly in the vision document, we establish a clear path for future implementation.

3. **Staged Rollout**: This approach allows:
   - Phase 1: CLI transformation (current focus)
   - Phase 2: Basic checkpointing (local storage)
   - Phase 3: Distributed checkpointing (Redis/etcd)
   - Phase 4: Advanced features (barriers, adaptive strategies)

## Next Steps

1. Complete flowctl CLI implementation without checkpointing
2. Gather user feedback on core CLI experience
3. Implement basic checkpointing in a future release
4. Gradually add advanced checkpoint features based on user needs
